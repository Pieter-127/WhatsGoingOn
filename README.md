# Summary
This project was made to learn about notifications and pull to refresh. It's just a really simple app and helps to serve as some reference for future work with notifications and scheduling notifications to run with the alarm manager

# How it's done
The app makes use of Kotlin and a few other libraries to create a native android application 

- Glide - For image loading and placeholders
- Coroutines - For performing tasks on different threads
- Retrofit - For a service call to the api
- Timber - For logging any errors or debugging
- Lottie - For the animation

...and a few more

# How would you run this ? 

You can simply clone this from github and open the project using android studio (the `master` branch is usually where the latest stable build can be found, `dev` is where I work on new features)  there shouldn't be any additional requirements or configurations needed.
